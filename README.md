# ScheduleOverlay

This is an experimental Electron.js project that creates an overlay of your schedule (or basically any text file) over your screen.

The aim for the project is simple. I wanted to create a daily schedule for myself, but I found it very hard to follow the schedule. The reason is that I don't see the schedule while I'm working. If the schedule is present on the screen at all times without obstructing my view of anything else, it would be better (i think).

Anyway, it seems like a good hobby project. It's also my first electron project, so wish me luck. Adios.

installation instructions will be provided later.
